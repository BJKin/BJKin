### Featured Projects

#### [EasyConnect](https://github.com/BJKin/EasyConnect--Final) — Smart Networking Wristband (Firmware)
#### [EasyConnect](https://github.com/BJKin/EasyConnect_SoftwareFinal) — Smart Networking Wristband (Web app)
An IoT wearable that exchanges contact info via handshake detection. Uses an embedded neural network processing IMU data, BLE device pairing based on RSSI, and MQTT for real-time profile exchange. Built with ESP-IDF, TensorFlow, and Django.

#### [ECE-176](https://github.com/BJKin/ECE-176) — Semantic Image Inpainting
A modern PyTorch re-implementation of *"Context Encoders: Feature Learning by Inpainting"* (Pathak et al., 2016). Developed encoder-decoder and GAN-based architectures trained with reconstruction and adversarial loss.
